alARM-Assembler
###########
An assembler for the alARM instruction set (for UC Davis ECS 154A, Fall '22)

Installation
============
.. code-block:: console

  $ git clone https://github.com/nkrim/alARM-assembler.git
  $ cd alARM-assembler
  $ make
  
Usage
=====
.. code-block:: console

  $ ./alarmas src_file out_file [-l] [-s]

Options
=======

======  ===========
Flag    Description
``-l``  Print program listing to standard error. Includes label map, address to machine-code list, and re-assembled instructions
``-s``  Turn on strict parsing to force correct syntax. For example, without ``-s`` the instruction ``LDR R0 R1 R2`` would be accepted, but with ``-s`` the assembler would require ``LDR R0, [R1, R2]`` (however, the assembler is always case-insensitive).
======  ===========


Notes
==========
- To load or store the ALU flags with the ``MOV`` instruction, you can reference ``Flags`` explicitly as an operand. For example, use ``MOV R0, Flags`` to load ``Flags`` into ``R0`` and use ``MOV Flags, R0`` to store ``R0`` into the ``Flags``. 

Bug Fixes
==========
- 11/17/22 9:30pm - fixed a bug that was causing every operand token to display as mnemonic instead in encoder errors.
- 11/19/22 8:30pm - fixed ``CMP`` encoding to use Rn and Rm spaces instead of Rd and Rn.
- 11/20/22 6:45pm - fixed ``MOV Flags, Rn`` encoding to use Rn instead of Rd.

Tests
==========
Includes five test files: 

- ``testinsts.s`` which includes every instruction in every format in order to ensure proper encoding.
- ``testerrors.s`` which should initiate an error on every line of the program, so it starts entirely commented in order to test for specific errors.
- ``teststrict.s`` which includes strictly formatted instructions and should be tested with the ``-s`` flag set.
- ``teststricterrors.s`` which should intiate an error on every line only when the ``-s`` flag is set.
- ``testhandencoded.s`` which has some instructions paired up with their hand-encoded hex in the comments, written by Dominic Quintero.

Examples
==========

*The instructions shown below are assembled from larger files, though they are presented here alone with their listing/error output merely for examples. However, interactive assembling in the terminal is a planned feature.*
